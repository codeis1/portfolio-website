              I am Ravol Ashmeade, a kid with a high drive to leave a positive
              mark on the world, I love football game... Video and reality, for
              me Messi is the best, hopefully that doesn{"'"}t get us on a bad
              start,ðŸ˜†if you are a CR7 fan just know he is great as well, so we
              are cool now right?ðŸ˜„my role model is Elon Musk, some of his
              traits that stands out to me the most are, his creativity,
              perseverance, and work ethic, he is relentless. I am looking
              forward on making a big impact on the world like him and even
              more.
